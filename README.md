# Instructions
- Create a new private repository using this one as the template.
- Invite Lorenzo Zuluaga ([L-Zuluaga](https://github.com/L-Zuluaga)) to the repository.
- Create a branch called `technical-challenge` were you will be adding all your work.

# Challenge
### Binary Search Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Each node contains a value and pointers to it's left and right children with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node.


**Example:**
```
                        5
                    /      \
                   3        12
                 /   \    /    \
                2     4  9      14
                        / \    /  \
                       8  11  13   19
```

Your task is to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) supporting the following operations:
- Insertion (Maintaining the BST property)
- Searching
- Traversal (Inorder, Postorder and Preorder)

For the purposes of this exercise, ignore any duplicate insertions (If a value is already present, do not insert it again).

# Additional details
- You can resolve the challenge using the programming language of your preference.

- You have 1.5 hours to complete the challenge.

- After finishing, upload the changes in a Pull Request, and request review from Lorenzo Zuluaga ([L-Zuluaga](https://github.com/L-Zuluaga)).


**Good luck :)**
